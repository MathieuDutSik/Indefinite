# Indefinite
This package contains several functions for working with integral indefinite forms:
* It can test if two indefinite forms are equivalent under the action of the general
linear groups over the integers. And if they are equivalent, it can provide a matrix
realizing the equivalence.
* It can provide a finite generating set of the automorphism group of a given
indefinite form.
* Given an integer C and an indefinite form A, it can find orbit representatives of
the solutions of the equation A[v] = C. If C = 0 then orbit representatives of
primitive isotropic vectors are provided.
* For an indefinite quadratic form having a signature (p,q) and k <= min(p,q) we
can find orbit representative of k-dimensional subspace if isotropic vectors.
* For an indefinite quadratic form having a signature (p,q) and k <= min(p,q) we
can find orbit representative of flags of length k.
